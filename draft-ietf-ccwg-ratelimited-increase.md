--- abstract

This document specifies how transport protocols increase their congestion window when the sender is rate-limited, and updates RFC 5681, RFC 9002, RFC 9260, and RFC 9438.
Such a limitation can be caused by the sending application not supplying data or by receiver flow control.

# Introduction

A sender of a congestion controlled transport protocol becomes "rate-limited" when it does not send any data
even though the congestion control rules would allow it to transmit data.
This could occur because the application has not provided sufficient data to fully utilise the congestion window (cwnd).
It could also occur because the receiver has limited the sender using flow control
(e.g., by the advertised TCP receiver window (rwnd) or by the connection or stream flow credit in QUIC).
Current RFCs specifying congestion control algorithms diverge regarding the rules for increasing the cwnd when the sender is rate-limited.

Congestion Window Validation (CWV) {{!RFC7661}} provides an experimental specification defining how to manage a cwnd that has
become larger than the current flight size.
In contrast, this present document concerns the increase in cwnd when a sender is rate-limited. These two topics are distinct,
but are related, because both describe the management of the cwnd when the sender does not fully utilise the current cwnd.

This document specifies a uniform rule that congestion control algorithms MUST apply and provides a recommendation that congestion control implementations SHOULD follow.
An appendix provides an overview of the divergence in current RFCs and some current implementations regarding cwnd increase when the sender is rate-limited.

## Terminology

This document uses the terms defined in {{Section 2 of !RFC5681}} and {{Section 3 of !RFC7661}}. Additionally, we define:

- maxFS: the largest value of FlightSize since the last time that cwnd was decreased. If cwnd has never been decreased, maxFS is the maximum value of FlightSize since the start of the data transfer.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Increase rules {#rules}

When FlightSize < cwnd, regardless of the current state of a congestion control algorithm, senders using a congestion controlled transport protocol:

1. MUST cap cwnd to be no larger than limit(maxFS).
2. MAY restrict maxFS as min(maxFS, pipeACK), using "pipeACK" as defined in {{!RFC7661}}.

In rule #1, the function limit() returns the maximum cwnd value the congestion control algorithm would yield by increasing from the value of the maxFS parameter within one RTT.
The RTT includes the minimum path propagation delay plus any delay accumulated by queing in the stack, at the interface and in network elements along the path.
For example, for Slow Start, as specified in {{!RFC5681}}, limit(maxFS)=2*maxFS, such that equation 2 in {{!RFC5681}} becomes:

~~~
cwnd_new = cwnd + min (N, SMSS)
cwnd = min(cwnd_new, 2*maxFS)
~~~
where cwnd and SMSS follow their definitions in {{!RFC5681}} and N is the number of previously unacknowledged bytes acknowledged in the incoming ACK.

Similarly, with rule #1 applied to Congestion Avoidance, limit(maxFS)=1+maxFS, such that equation 3 in {{!RFC5681}} becomes:

~~~
cwnd_new = cwnd + SMSS*SMSS/cwnd
cwnd = min(cwnd_new, 1+maxFS)
~~~
where cwnd and SMSS follow their definitions in {{!RFC5681}}.

As with cwnd, without a way to reduce it when the transport sender becomes rate-limited, rule #1 allows for maxFS to stay valid for a long time, possibly not reflecting the reality of the end-to-end Internet path in use. For cwnd, this is remedied by "Congestion Window Validation" in {{!RFC7661}}, which also defines a "pipeACK" variable that measures the acknowledged size of the network pipe when the sender is rate-limited. Accordingly, to implement CWV, rule #2 can be used.

## Example
We illustrate the working of the rules by showing the increase of cwnd in two scenarios: when the growth of cwnd is unconstrained, and when it is constrained by the increase rules. In both cases we assume initial cwnd (initcwnd) = 10 segments, as defined for TCP in {{?RFC6928}}, QUIC in {{?RFC9002}}, a single connection begins with Slow Start, the sender transmits a total of 14 segments but pauses after transmitting 10 segments and resumes the transmission for the remaining 4 segments afterwards, no packets are lost, and an ACK is sent for every packet.

### Unconstrained sender
Initially, cwnd = initcwnd. Therefore, using initcwnd = 10 segments, as defined for TCP in {{?RFC6928}}, QUIC in {{?RFC9002}}, the sender transmits 10 segments and pauses. Since the sender is in the Slow Start phase, the arrival of an ACK for each of the 10 segments increases the cwnd by 1 segment, resulting in the cwnd increasing to 20 segments. Subsequently, after the pause, the sender transmits 4 segments and pauses again. As a consequence, the arrival of 4 ACKs results in cwnd further increasing to 24 segments even though the sender is rate-limited (i.e., has never sent more than 10 segments/RTT).

### Sender constrained by the increase rules
Initially, cwnd = initcwnd. Therefore, using initcwnd = 10 segments, as defined for TCP in {{?RFC6928}}, QUIC in {{?RFC9002}}, the sender transmits 10 segments and pauses; note that FlightSize and maxFS are 10 segments at this point. Since the sender is in the Slow Start phase, the arrival of an ACK for each of the 10 segments increases the cwnd by 1 segment, resulting in cwnd increasing to 20 segments. Subsequently, when the sender resumes and transmits 4 segments, rule #1 constrains the growth of cwnd because FlightSize < cwnd and rule #1 caps cwnd to be no larger than limit(maxFS) = 2*maxFS = 2*10 segments = 20 segments.

## Discussion

If the sending rate is less than permitted by cwnd for multiple RTTs, limited either by the sending application or by the receiver-advertised window, continuously increasing the cwnd would cause a mismatch between the cwnd and the capacity that the path supports (i.e., over-estimating the capacity).
Such unlimited growth in the cwnd is therefore disallowed.

However, in most common congestion control algorithms, in the absence of an indication of congestion, a cwnd that has been fully utilized during an RTT is permitted to be increased during the immediately following RTT.
Thus, such an increase is allowed by the first rule.


### Rate-based congestion control

The present document updates congestion control specifications that use a congestion window (cwnd) to limit the number of unacknowledged packets a sender is allowed to emit. Use of a congestion window variable to control sending rate is not the only mechanism available and used in practice.

Congestion control algorithms can also constrain data transmission by explicitly calculating the sending rate over some time interval, by "pacing" packets (injecting pauses in between their transmission) or via combinations of the above (e.g., BBR combines these three methods {{?I-D.cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control}}). The guiding principle behind the rules in {{rules}} applies to all  congestion control algorithms: in the absence of a congestion indication, a sender should be allowed to increase its rate from the amount of data that it has transmitted during the previous RTT. This holds irrespective of whether the sender is rate-limited or not.


### Pacing

Pacing mechanisms seek to avoid the negative impacts associated with "bursts" (flights of packets transmitted back-to-back). This is usually without limiting the number of packets that are sent per RTT. The present specification introduces a limitation using "maxFS", which is measured over an RTT; thus, as long as the number of packets per RTT is unaffected by pacing, the rules in {{rules}} also do not constrain the use of pacing mechanisms.


# Security Considerations

While congestion control designs could result in unwanted competing traffic, they do not directly result in new security considerations.

Transport protocols that provide authentication (including those using encryption), or are carried over protocols that provide authentication,
can protect their congestion control algorithm from network attack. This is orthogonal to the congestion control rules.

# The state of RFCs and implementations

This section is provided as input for IETF discussion, and should be removed before publication.

## TCP ("Reno" congestion control)

### Specification

{{!RFC7661}} suggests there is no increase limitation in the standard TCP behavior (which {{!RFC7661}} changes), on page 4:

>Standard TCP does not impose additional restrictions on the growth of
the congestion window when a TCP sender is unable to send at the
maximum rate allowed by the cwnd. In this case, the rate-limited
sender may grow a cwnd far beyond that corresponding to the current
transmit rate, resulting in a value that does not reflect current
information about the state of the network path the flow is using.

### Implementation {#tcp-impl}

- ns-2 allows cwnd to grow when it is rate-limited by rwnd. (Rate-limited by the sending application: not tested.)
- Until release 3.42, ns-3 allowed cwnd to grow when rate-limited, either due to an application or rwnd limit.  Since release 3.42, ns-3 TCP models conform to rule #1 in {{rules}}, following the current Linux TCP approach in this regard (see next bullet).
- In Congestion Avoidance, Linux only allows the cwnd to grow when the sender is unconstrained.
Before kernel version 3.16, this also applied to Slow Start.
The check for "unconstrained" is perfomed by checking if FlightSize is greater or equal to cwnd.
Since kernel version 3.16, which was published in August 2014, in Slow Start, the increase
implements rule #1 in {{rules}} in the `tcp_is_cwnd_limited` function in `tcp.h`.

### Assessment

Linux implements a limit to cwnd growth in accordance with rule #1 in {{rules}};
in Slow Start, this limit follows the rule's upper limit, while in Congestion Avoidance, it is more conservative than rule #1.
The specification and the ns-2 and (older) ns-3 implementations are in conflict with rule #1 in {{rules}}.

## CUBIC

### Specification

{{Section 5.8 of !RFC9438}} says:

>Cubic doesn't increase cwnd when it's limited by the sending application or rwnd.

### Implementation

The description of Linux described in {{tcp-impl}} also applies to Cubic.

### Assessment

Both the specification and the Linux implementation limit the cwnd growth in accordance with rule #1 in {{rules}};
in Congestion Avoidance, this limit is more conservative than rule #1 in {{rules}},
and in Slow Start, it implements the upper limit of rule #1 in {{rules}}.

## SCTP

### Specification

{{Section 7.2.1 of !RFC9260}} says:

>When cwnd is less than or equal to ssthresh, an SCTP endpoint MUST use the slow-start algorithm to
increase cwnd only if the current congestion window is being fully utilized and the data sender
is not in Fast Recovery.
Only when these two conditions are met can the cwnd be increased; otherwise, the cwnd MUST NOT be increased.

### Assessment

The quoted statement from {{!RFC9260}} prescribes the same cwnd growth limitation that is also specified for Cubic and implemented for both Reno and Cubic in Linux.
It is in accordance with rule #1 in {{rules}}, and more conservative.

{{Section 7.2.1 of !RFC9260}} is specifically limited to Slow Start.
Congestion Avoidance is discussed in {{Section 7.2.2 of !RFC9260}}
However, this section neither contains a similar rule, nor does it refer back to the rule that limits the growth of cwnd
in Section 7.2.1. It is thus implicitly clear that the quoted rule only applies to Slow Start, whereas the rules in {{rules}} apply to both Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance.

## QUIC

### Specification

{{Section 7.8 of !RFC9002}} states:

>When bytes in flight is smaller than the congestion window and sending is not pacing limited, the congestion window is underutilized. This can happen due to insufficient application data or flow control limits. When this occurs, the congestion window SHOULD NOT be increased in either slow start or congestion avoidance.

### Assessment

With the exception of pacing, this specification conservatively limits the growth in cwnd, similar to Cubic and SCTP. It is in accordance with rule #1 in {{rules}}, and more conservative.

## DCCP CCID2

### Specification

{{Section 5.1 of ?RFC4341}} states:
>There are currently no standards governing TCP's use of the congestion window during an application-limited period.  In particular, it is possible for TCP's congestion window to grow quite large during a long uncongested period when the sender is application limited, sending at a low rate.  {{?RFC2861}} essentially suggests that TCP's congestion window not be increased during application-limited periods when the congestion window is not being fully utilized.

### Assessment

A DCCP Congestion Control ID (CCID) specifing TCP-like behaviour ought to follow the method specified in this document. The current guidance relates only to {{?RFC2861}}.
The text in {{Section 5.1 of ?RFC4341}} is updated by this document to specify the management of the
cwnd during an application-limited period.
