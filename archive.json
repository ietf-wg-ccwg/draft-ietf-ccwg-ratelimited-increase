It also seems that the first sentence in section 4.4.2 of RFC 7661 is what this draft specifically addresses:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   TCP congestion control allows a sender to accumulate a cwnd that\r\n   would allow it to send a burst of segments with a total size up to\r\n   the difference between the FlightSize and cwnd. \r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we are proposing that TCP congestion control not allow a sender to accumulate an unlimited cwnd, so perhaps this needs to be clarified more directly (e.g., \"one could follow RFC 7661 and other RFCs and let cwnd accumulate to large values and then later perform CWV, or one could constrain the growth of cwnd during application-limited phases, or both.  This draft proposes guidelines for bounding the growth of cwnd during application-limited intervals.\")",

A sender SHOULD NOT consider itself application limited if it would have fully utilized the congestion window without pacing delay.\r\n\r\n... Ah this is MUCH more complicated.\r\nI suggest there are two uses of pacing by a transport protocol:\r\n1. {Burst Mitigation}. QUIC and TCP recommend the use of pacing to avoid generating long bursts. \r\nThis adds a small fixed delay after sending a burst of 10 contiguous packets, \r\nto avoid exceeding the interface buffers of network equipment. \r\n2. {Rate-Based Pacing}.\r\nThis pacing is designed to avoid triggering \r\ncongestion by limiting the rate near that of the presumed bottleneck, as in BBR, Vegas.\r\n\r\nThe 1st doesn't really cause under use of cwnd, the latter can. Do we agree on this?\r\n",

There's a fixed hardcoded 10 packet burst in Linux pacing, maybe that's what you think of?  but that's only the first 10 packets of IW (and repeating every 2^32 packets  :-D  ) and never again.\r\n\r\nI think there are three possible approaches:\r\n1) Just leave the statement there for now, knowing that this may need tweaking. I tend towards this.\r\n2) Remove it.\r\n3) Say something like [pacing to be discussed in a future version]\r\n\r\nWhat should we do?\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I think that pacing might in fact not make a difference for senders implementing our maxFs rule - because this essentially allows to increase \"as normal\" on the basis of the last RTT, and pacing happens in sub-RTT time scales...  i.e., the rule should normally make a paced sender automatically apply the rules of a \"greedy\" sender, removing the need to even say something about pacing perhaps?",

Pacing should never take breaks as long as that - it's always at sub-RTT time scales (and: why would we want to allow even larger time scales?).\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to make this clearer in text instead.",
