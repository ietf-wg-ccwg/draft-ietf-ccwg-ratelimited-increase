It also seems that the first sentence in section 4.4.2 of RFC 7661 is what this draft specifically addresses:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   TCP congestion control allows a sender to accumulate a cwnd that\r\n   would allow it to send a burst of segments with a total size up to\r\n   the difference between the FlightSize and cwnd. \r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we are proposing that TCP congestion control not allow a sender to accumulate an unlimited cwnd, so perhaps this needs to be clarified more directly (e.g., \"one could follow RFC 7661 and other RFCs and let cwnd accumulate to large values and then later perform CWV, or one could constrain the growth of cwnd during application-limited phases, or both.  This draft proposes guidelines for bounding the growth of cwnd during application-limited intervals.\")",

A sender SHOULD NOT consider itself application limited if it would have fully utilized the congestion window without pacing delay.\r\n\r\n... Ah this is MUCH more complicated.\r\nI suggest there are two uses of pacing by a transport protocol:\r\n1. {Burst Mitigation}. QUIC and TCP recommend the use of pacing to avoid generating long bursts. \r\nThis adds a small fixed delay after sending a burst of 10 contiguous packets, \r\nto avoid exceeding the interface buffers of network equipment. \r\n2. {Rate-Based Pacing}.\r\nThis pacing is designed to avoid triggering \r\ncongestion by limiting the rate near that of the presumed bottleneck, as in BBR, Vegas.\r\n\r\nThe 1st doesn't really cause under use of cwnd, the latter can. Do we agree on this?\r\n",

There's a fixed hardcoded 10 packet burst in Linux pacing, maybe that's what you think of?  but that's only the first 10 packets of IW (and repeating every 2^32 packets  :-D  ) and never again.\r\n\r\nI think there are three possible approaches:\r\n1) Just leave the statement there for now, knowing that this may need tweaking. I tend towards this.\r\n2) Remove it.\r\n3) Say something like [pacing to be discussed in a future version]\r\n\r\nWhat should we do?\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I think that pacing might in fact not make a difference for senders implementing our maxFs rule - because this essentially allows to increase \"as normal\" on the basis of the last RTT, and pacing happens in sub-RTT time scales...  i.e., the rule should normally make a paced sender automatically apply the rules of a \"greedy\" sender, removing the need to even say something about pacing perhaps?",

Here it comes, from an email on 20.7.2024:\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael, I really like your doc!\r\n\r\nCan I suggest a slightly different and stronger direction?\r\n1) Make maxFS central and add the timestamp of the most recent ACK that supports  (within 1 segment of) the current value of maxFS.  I will assume maxFStime.\r\n\r\nObserve that maxFS and maxFStime can be precisely defined and  accurately estimated from a packet capture.\r\n\r\n2) Generalize the \"increase function\", citing 5681 as an non-normative example\r\n\r\n3) Change Increase rule 1 to:  Allow growth when maxFS matches cwnd and is within one RTT of maxFStime.  This specifically allows increases during application limited phases if there is a recent observation that cwnd fits in the pipe.   Although a completely different implementation, this is more closely aligned with the way that linux behaves.   This detail is known to be important to some applications.  e.g DASH video, when the chunk size is similar to the pipe size. \r\n\r\n4) Imagine in the future, recasting several other algorithms by replacing cwnd with time decaying filters applied to maxFS.   All such filters should probably decay in parallel, and represent estimates of the total acceleration of the cross traffic at the bottleneck.\r\n\r\nNote that for a start/stop application, restart after idle can estimate the distribution of the cross traffic's acceleration.  This is the one part of CC where I would expect that simple ML might do better than a hand crafted algorithm.\r\n",

I think the time-proposed limit is overly conservative: what if maxFS is 30 segments in one RTT, and becomes 35 in the next, even though the sender is rate-limited?   Hence I think it's better to point at using pipeACK from RFC 7661 as a MAY (since this is an Experimental RFC).\r\nAbout item 4: too conservative too, then?",

      "body": "The draft provides well-defined rules for constraining _cwnd_ growth when the sender is rate-limited. However, in scenarios where the sender remains consistently below _maxFS_ for an extended period, additional guidance on how _cwnd_ should evolve over time could enhance clarity. Ensuring that _cwnd_ accurately reflects the available network capacity in such cases may help maintain efficient congestion control behavior.\n\n**Potential Considerations**:\n\n1. **Ensuring accurate _cwnd_ adaptation**: If a sender remains rate-limited for multiple RTTs, there may be value in specifying how _cwnd_ should evolve to avoid potential overestimation of network capacity.\n2. **Clarifying the role of CWV (Congestion Window Validation)**: While RFC 7661 provides mechanisms for _cwnd_ validation, explicitly referencing its applicability in the context of persistent rate-limitation could be beneficial.\n3. **Alignment with real network conditions**: Providing guidance on how _cwnd_ should adapt when rate-limitation persists for an extended period could help maintain an accurate reflection of the path\u2019s characteristics.\n\n**Proposed Enhancement**:\n\n- Clarify whether an adjustment mechanism for _cwnd_ under prolonged rate-limitation is needed, and if so, how it should be handled.\n- Consider referencing CWV from RFC 7661 more explicitly as a possible approach or suggest alternative guidance for such scenarios.\n- Define conditions under which the sender might need to re-evaluate _cwnd_ to ensure alignment with actual network conditions.\n\nThese considerations could further strengthen the draft by ensuring that _cwnd_ behaves optimally even in cases of persistent rate-limitation.",

If I'm not mistaken, they allow for anything below a full RTT of ACK ignorance (I mean: not increasing cwnd when ACKs arrive), followed by immediately increasing cwnd as the congestion control rules allow (e.g., +1 in Reno CA or *2 in slow start). Pacing should never take breaks as long as that - it's always at sub-RTT time scales (and: why would we want to allow even larger time scales?).\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to make this clearer in text instead.",

Since the sender is in the Slow Start phase, the arrival of an ACK for each of the 10 segments increases the cwnd by 1 segment, resulting in cwnd increasing to 20 segments. Subsequently, when the sender resumes and transmits 4 segments, rule #1 constrains the growth of cwnd because FlightSize < cwnd and rule #2 caps cwnd to be no larger than limit(maxFS) = 2*maxFS = 2*10 segments = 20 segments.\r\n```",
